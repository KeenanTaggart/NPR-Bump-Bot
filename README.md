*This is a student project. Consequently, this code is not likely (at this time) to be "good," nor will it necessarily conform all that well 
to any kind of style guide. It accomplishes a goal and helped introduce the author to new subjects and tools. Criticism is welcome, 
but it must be scathing.*
## What This Does
The project is comprised of a small handful of scripts which perform discrete tasks. In concert they complete the following:
1. Get track and artist names from daily NPR programs.
2. Submit the scraped information to the Spotify API, receiving links for the specified tracks.
3. Post a few links to a designated Twitter account (@nprBumpBot).
