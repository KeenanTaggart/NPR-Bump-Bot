# NPR Bump Bot


The project is comprised of a small handful of scripts which perform discrete tasks. In concert they complete the following:
1. Get track and artist names from daily NPR programs.
2. Submit the scraped information to the Spotify API, receiving links for the specified tracks.
3. Post a few links to a designated Twitter account (@nprBumpBot).

The Twitter account has been in operation for ~1.5 years at the time of this writing.
